<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:freeroad:"> James Stemple is a self-proclaimed video editor and animator. <br> Years ago while watching an animated short, he said to himself "yeah, I wanna do that," and so he did.<br> He's skilled in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite as well as other programs such as Maya for 3D animation <br> and avidemux for datamoshing (man does he love datamoshing).</h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:freeroad:"> He's driven by the need for self-expression and passion for manipulating pixels. Some would say James is determined, <br>sometimes stubbornly so, like when he decided to make his own website from scratch instead of getting a premade one.</h3>
